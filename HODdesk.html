            <p class="parra1">Department of Applied Science and General Engineering. (ASGE) is comprised of applied science faculties, i.e., Engineering Mathematics, Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry and basic engineering faculties namely, Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The first year syllabus of all engineering branches being common our department is entrusted with the responsibility of centrally coordinating the studies and activities of all the first year engineering (FE) students.</p>
            <p class="parra2">Faculty Details</p>

In addition, two faculty members are pursuing their doctoral studies. Our faculty members are actively involved in Research and development activities and the department has obtained research grants from Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Board for College and University Development (BCUD). Faculty members have published a large number of research papers in National and International journals. Staff members attend seminars and workshops to keep abreast of latest developments in the field. They also attend syllabus implementation and syllabus revision workshops and actively participate in University activities.</p>
