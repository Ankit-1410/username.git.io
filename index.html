                    <p class="parra1">Department of Applied Science and General Engineering. (ASGE) is comprised of applied science faculties, i.e., Engineering Mathematics, Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry and basic engineering faculties namely, Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The first year syllabus of all engineering branches being common our department is entrusted with the responsibility of centrally coordinating the studies and activities of all the first year engineering (FE) students.</p>
                    <p class="parra2">Faculty Details</p>
                    <p class="parra1">All faculty members of our department hold post-graduate degrees in their respective fields and four faculty members hold PhD degrees. In addition, two faculty members are pursuing their doctoral studies. Our faculty members are actively involved in Research and development activities and the department has obtained research grants from Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Board for College and University Development (BCUD). Faculty members have published a large number of research papers in National and International journals. Staff members attend seminars and workshops to keep abreast of latest developments in the field. They also attend syllabus implementation and syllabus revision workshops and actively participate in University activities.</p>
                    <p class="parra2">Teaching Learning</p>
                    <p class="parra1">Our department has well designed and fully equipped laboratories for Civil engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Electrical engineering, Engineering Physics and Engineering Chemistry. Our classrooms are equipped with PCs and projection facilities and classes are made interactive with the use of power point presentations, videos and demos, Students access learning material, PPT's and videos on Moodle- E-learning software. Mock online examinations are also conducted on Moodle. An orientation and induction program is organized in every session for each batch of fresh students.</p>
                    <p class="parra2">Beyond syllabus</p>
                    <p class="parra1">Students work on study based mini-projects, give seminars and submit the project reports on latest developments and interdisciplinary topics. Soft skill classes by professionals are conducted for students who are found to be weak in English. Guest lectures are regularly arranged by experts from academics and Industry. Our alumni also like to come back to their Alma mater and interact with their juniors.
                        <br>
                    Inspite of being freshers our students actively participate and do well in inter- and intra- collegiate technical, cultural and sports events.</p>
                    <p class="parra2">Results</p>
                    <p class="parra1">Results of our first year students are one of the best amongst all private engineering colleges in Pune with pass percentage being in the range of 98-99%. In addition, a large number of students score first class and distinction. In 2022-23 the percentage of students scoring distinction was 53% and 16% students scored first class.</p>
